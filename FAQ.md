## What is "root"? ##

"Root" is Linux/Unix almighty user - system administrator.

Here is some information about "rooting" G1 (enabling access to root user from applications) http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=442480

## Broken pipe? ##

If You get "Broken pipe", it basically means you can't open data stream between application and su utility(for root access).

Problem solving:
  * Is Your phone "rooted"? If not, program can't perform actions as "root".
  * Do You have "su" utility in your system? If not, consider of installing it ( I'm using su with "Superuser Whitelist" application from http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=475381 JFv1.43 Holiday firmware)
