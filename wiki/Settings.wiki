Program have 2 changeable settings - swap size and location. In program you can also change swappiness of system.

= Details =

==Swap size==

Size of file for swapping. Here info for reading http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_space

==Location==

Path where to place swap file (Locations buttons contains predefined paths, one is /sdcard/swapfile.swp, other is /system/sd/swapfile.swp - for those, who divided their sd cards for application sorage).

==In-Program system settings==
In program you have swappiness option - range 0-100 - how much you would like to swap. My tests showed that best performance/usability (for my sd+phone) is 32 MB swap and swappiness = 10. Your preferences can differ.
