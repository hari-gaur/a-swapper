= Misuse =

  * Swapper doesn't create swap partition, it should be already available.
  * Swap partition is not same as ext2/3 partition, it normally doesn't mount in linux, it contains no files.
  * Swapper can format any existing partition to swap partition, but *ALL DATA ON THAT PARTITION WILL BE LOST*
  * With enabled "Recreate swap file" but disabled "Reformat swap" created swap file will not be of any use (enabling swap will fail!)
